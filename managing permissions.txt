By default, this app will have three users, each with different access permissions for different parts of the app. These permissions are defined as "groups" to which a user can be assigned. Any number of new users can be created, and their permissions individually defined.

To create a user, access the Django admin page at localhost:8000/admin. You must sign in with a user that has staff privileges. Once you make a new user, assign them the appropriate group for the permission level desired (see below). Staff privileges are assigned with a checkbox in admin page, not by group assignment. (By default, only the 'admin' user has staff privileges.)

Users and Groups are managed in the Django admin interface, which can be accessed by any user with staff privileges. 
The default users, which should serve as models for new users that will be created, are:

1) admin (default password=admin)
groups assigned: 'edit' and 'rdm'
staff privileges: yes
  This user can create new resources ('edit'), access the RDM ('rdm'), and access the admin page (staff priliveges)

2) editor (default password=editor)
groups assigned: 'edit'
staff privileges: no
  This use can create new resources, but cannot edit the RDM, nor access the admin page.

3) anonymous (no password)
This is the user that is assigned by default to any unauthorized vistor to the website. No access to any edit, rdm, or staff privileges.
